**fisicus is a cli tool that allows seo analysts to filter a target sitemap with a desired pattern.**

# About

With our **_b-nova_** collection of microservices, we're offering a complete set of modules which enables our JAMstack.
fisicus is an important module as it reads and forwards a customized sitemap from a given website.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->

* You have installed the latest version of `go1.16.5`
* You have a `Linux/Mac OS` machine with working knowledge of the underlying filesystem and Go build process.

# Installation

1. Download and extract fisicus to your web directory or get the latest development version with:

```
$ ‚ùØ  git clone https://github.com/b-nova-openhub/filter-sitemap-customizer
```

2. Check the run configuration in `fisicus.sh`. Adjust `SITEMAP` and `FILTER` if necessary.

3. Run `make init` inside the directory. This is going to resolve the required Go dependencies, build and run the
   application.
4. The fisicus web service should now be served under `:8080/sitemap`.
5. While the web service is running, you can overwrite the specified configs with the request params `sitemap`
   and `filter` within that request at any moment. **
   Example:** `:8080/sitemap?filter=/home/about/*&sitemap=https://yourwebsite.com/sitemaps/sitemap.xml`

# Build

You can build fisicus with the provided Makefile. In order to do so, execute following command in the projects root
directory.

```
$ ‚ùØ  make all
```

:beginner:: If you're building for the first time and jumped ahead of this README, replace `make all` with `make init`.
